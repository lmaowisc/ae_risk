-   A consortium of academic and industry partners aiming to use survival analysis techniques to address varying follow-up times and competing events in AE analysis.

### Literature review

-   @unkel2018:
    -   Advocates for a structured framework to define *what* is being estimated in AE analyses (estimand)
    -   Proposes the Aalen-Johansen estimator as the most appropriate tool for estimating cumulative AE probabilities in the presence of censoring and competing risks

-  SAVVY publications [@rufibach2024]:
    -   In presence of competing events and censoring, considered
        -   Aalen-Johansen estimator for cumulative AE probability
        -   Hazard-based estimators (cause-specific hazard)
        -   One minus Kaplan-Meier estimator (uninterpretable)
        -   Incidence proportion (based by censoring)
        $$
        \mbox{Incidence Proportion (IP)}= \frac{\mbox{Number of patients with at least one AE}}
        {\mbox{Total number of patients in the study group}}
        $$
    -   Advocates for the Aalen-Johansen estimator as the gold standard for estimating cumulative AE probabilities
